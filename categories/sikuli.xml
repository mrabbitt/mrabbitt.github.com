The game chooses the character's initial statistics by simulated random dice rolls.  You can re-distribute points between different attributes as you desire, but you can only increase the total number of points by re-rolling.  You can re-roll as many times as you want, hoping to get a higher total number of points.  You can also "store" and "recall" a single roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lazy programmer in me saw this as an a task begging for automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next several hours developing a &lt;a href="http://sikuli.org"&gt;Sikuli&lt;/a&gt; script which automates the process of re-rolling until a desired total roll is reached.  I've finally gotten around to cleaning up the code and releasing it on github as &lt;a href="https://github.com/mrabbitt/BGEE_Sikuli_auto_roller"&gt;BGEE_Sikuli_auto_roller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video demo (painfully edited in iMovie) of &lt;code&gt;BGEE_Sikuli_auto_roller&lt;/code&gt; in action:&lt;/p&gt;
