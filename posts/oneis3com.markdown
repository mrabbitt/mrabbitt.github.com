Today I set up a new coding blog on [oneis3.com](http://oneis3.com).  I've tinkered in the past with Blogger and Tumblr, but this time I decided to go with a different solution which gives me more control of my content.  This site is generated using [Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar), a static site generator implemented in Python.  Hosting is provided via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) (see the [mrabbitt.github.com repo](https://github.com/mrabbitt/mrabbitt.github.com)).

I've been writing lots of little Python scripts and JavaScript bookmarlets lately which I hope to share here.  Perhaps some [Grails](http://grails.org)/[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org)/Java discoveries from my day job will also find there way here.
